4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test offline functionality
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test install prompt

### Deployment Requirements:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HTTPS is REQUIRED** (Service workers only work on HTTPS or localhost)
- ‚úÖ Deploy the entire `build/` directory

### Recommended Hosting Platforms:
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, HTTPS, easy setup
- **Netlify**: Free tier, automatic deployments, HTTPS
- **Vercel**: Free tier, optimized for SPAs, HTTPS
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Free, fast, HTTPS

2. **Test Locally**: Follow the testing checklist above
3. **Fix Icons**: Place generated icons in `static/` and rebuild

### For Deployment:
1. Choose a hosting platform
2. Configure deployment (see your current `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`)
3. Deploy the `build/` directory
4. Test the deployed app
5. Verify PWA features work on HTTPS

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ **Build Time**: Fast (~8 seconds total)
‚úÖ **Bundle Size**: Reasonable (all chunks < 35KB)
‚úÖ **Service Worker**: Auto-generated and functional
‚úÖ **Manifest**: Properly configured
‚úÖ **Prerendering**: Working for static generation

## Troubleshooting

### If install prompt doesn't appear:
- Make sure you're on HTTPS (or localhost)
- Check DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Manifest for errors
- Icons must be present in `static/`
- Clear browser cache and reload

### If service worker doesn't register:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify HTTPS (service workers require secure context)
- Check that `sw.js` is accessible at root

### If offline mode doesn't work:
- Verify service worker is activated
- Check Cache Storage has files
- Ensure all resources are being cached
