# HIGH SOCIETY RULES
A GAME BY REINER KNIZIA
[cite_start]Illustrated by MEDUSA DOLLMAKER [cite: 1, 2]

[cite_start]You are the cultural elite, the quintessential bon vivants, the true icons of the age[cite: 3]. [cite_start]The competition is fierce amidst highborn and nouveau riche to assert your status and earn prestige in the eyes of your peers[cite: 4]. [cite_start]Adorn yourself with splendid jewellery and high fashion, enjoy fine cuisine and fizzing champagne, and waste away money in casinos and at the races[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Show off your exquisite palette and excellent tastes, but don't be caught penniless or be cast out as an impostor! [cite: 6] Fashion is fickle but style is forever. [cite_start]Show them what it really means to be a member of High Society[cite: 7].

***

## [cite_start]Components [cite: 8]

* [cite_start]**16 STATUS CARDS** [cite: 9]
    * [cite_start]**10 luxury cards** (Numbered 1 to 10, and increase your status)[cite: 10, 18].
    * [cite_start]**3 prestige cards** (Multiply your status, and count down to the end of the game)[cite: 11, 19].
    * [cite_start]**3 disgrace cards** (Decrease your status in different ways)[cite: 12, 20].
* [cite_start]**5 SETS OF 11 MONEY CARDS** [cite: 21]
    * [cite_start]Example values: 4,000, 15,000, 25,000, and 29,000 Francs (The card values are in Francs)[cite: 22, 23, 24, 25].

***

## [cite_start]Setup [cite: 26]

1.  [cite_start]Give each player a set of eleven money cards of the same colour to keep secret in their hand[cite: 27].
2.  [cite_start]Shuffle the status cards and place them as a face-down deck in the middle of the table[cite: 28].
3.  [cite_start]The player who shuffled the deck starts the game[cite: 29].

## [cite_start]How to Play [cite: 30]

[cite_start]Players are socialites trying to live as lavishly and frivolously as possible, outbidding each other to prove they are living life to the fullest[cite: 31, 32, 33]. [cite_start]At the end of the game, the poorest player (or players) will be cast out of the group[cite: 34]. [cite_start]The remaining player who has managed to become the most fashionable, by collecting the highest value status cards, will earn the envy of all and win the game[cite: 35, 36].

***

## [cite_start]Auction Rounds [cite: 37]

[cite_start]At the start of each round, flip the top card of the status deck face-up; this card will now go to the highest bidder[cite: 38]. [cite_start]The starting player must either bid or pass[cite: 39].

### [cite_start]Bidding [cite: 40]

* [cite_start]To bid, you must play one or more money cards face-up in front of you and announce the total of all your face-up money cards[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]If you have already bid this round, you can only increase your bid by adding new cards to the ones already on the table�you cannot pick up cards you have already played[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]You can only bid if your new total is higher than the previous bid made this round[cite: 43].

### [cite_start]Passing [cite: 44]

* [cite_start]If you don't want to bid, you may pass instead[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]If you have already bid this round, return all of your face-up money cards to your hand[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]You may no longer bid this round[cite: 47].

### Ending the Round

* [cite_start]When a player has either bid or passed, the turn moves to the player to their left[cite: 48].
* [cite_start]The last remaining player after everyone else has passed wins the auction[cite: 49]!
* [cite_start]If everyone passes without making a bid (rare), the last remaining player gets the card for free[cite: 50].
* [cite_start]Place the contested status card face-up in front of the winner[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]Discard all of the money cards on the table face-down[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]The winner of the auction becomes the starting player for the new round, and reveals the next status card from the deck[cite: 53].

***

## [cite_start]Disgrace! [cite: 54]

[cite_start]If the revealed status card is a disgrace card, the auction works slightly differently[cite: 55].

* [cite_start]This time you are **bidding to avoid taking the card**[cite: 56].
* [cite_start]The round will end as soon as any one player passes[cite: 56].
* [cite_start]That player picks up their money cards as usual, but **must take the disgrace card** and place it in front of them[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]All other players must discard their money cards on the table face-down[cite: 58].
* [cite_start]The passing player starts the next round[cite: 58].
* [cite_start]Discarded status cards are returned to the box[cite: 64].

### Disgrace Card Effects

* [cite_start]**Faux Pas:** If a player takes the **Faux Pas** card, they must immediately discard one of the luxury cards in front of them (their choice)[cite: 59, 60]. [cite_start]If they currently have no luxury cards, they must discard the next luxury card they receive[cite: 61]. [cite_start]Once a luxury card has been discarded, discard the Faux Pas card[cite: 62]. (Luxury cards are those with a value between 1 and 10) [cite_start][cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Pass� Card:** Reduces a player's status by 5[cite: 67, 68, 69].
* [cite_start]**Scandale Card:** Halves the player's status at the end of the game[cite: 70, 71, 72, 75].

***

## [cite_start]Game End [cite: 78]

[cite_start]Four cards in the status deck have a dark green background: the three prestige cards and the **Scandale** card[cite: 79, 80]. [cite_start]As soon as the fourth one is revealed, the game ends immediately, with no bidding for the revealed card[cite: 80].

### [cite_start]Cast Out! [cite: 81]

[cite_start]All players reveal their hands and announce the total of their remaining money cards[cite: 82]. [cite_start]The player or players with the least remaining money are **cast out, and cannot win**! [cite: 83]

### [cite_start]Scoring [cite: 84]

1.  [cite_start]Each luxury card awards status equal to its value[cite: 85].
2.  [cite_start]Each prestige card **doubles** the owning player's status, while the disgrace cards decrease the status[cite: 85].
3.  [cite_start]The player with the highest status that hasn't been cast out wins[cite: 86].
4.  **Tie-breakers:**
    * [cite_start]If there is a tie, the player with the most money left wins[cite: 87].
    * [cite_start]If there is still a tie, the player with the single most valuable luxury card wins[cite: 88].

### [cite_start]Clarifications [cite: 89]

* [cite_start]The status cards a player has accumulated are always visible face-up in front of them[cite: 90].
* [cite_start]The money cards they have spent are always hidden face-down[cite: 91].
* [cite_start]If you have two prestige cards, multiply your status by four[cite: 92]. [cite_start]If you have all three, multiply your status by eight[cite: 93].

## [cite_start]Scoring Example [cite: 94]

[cite_start]Rahul has the following status cards in front of him: **Luxury Cards** (e.g., *Haute Cuisine* 3, *Dressage* 9), **Disgrace Cards** (*Pass�* -5, *Scandale*), and **Prestige Cards** (*Bon Vivant*, *Joie De Vivre*)[cite: 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107].

1.  [cite_start]He first adds up his luxury cards for a total of **12**[cite: 108].
2.  [cite_start]He then has to lose **5** due to being caught *Pass�*, for a running total of **7**[cite: 108].
3.  [cite_start]Rahul then gets to double his status **twice** because of his two prestige cards (7 x 2 x 2), for a total of **28**! [cite: 108, 92]
4.  [cite_start]Finally, the *Scandale* card **halves** his status (28 / 2), leaving Rahul with a total of **14**[cite: 109].
